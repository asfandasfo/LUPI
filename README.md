Learning using Privileged Information for Chemosensitivity Prediction in Ovarian Cancer Patients.

Whole slide images (WSI's) and gene expression data is taken from GDC Data Portal. Whole slide images can be download from [here](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files&filters=%7B%22op%22%3A%22and%22%2C%22content%22%3A%5B%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.program.name%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22cases.project.project_id%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22TCGA-OV%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.data_type%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22Slide%20Image%22%5D%7D%7D%2C%7B%22op%22%3A%22in%22%2C%22content%22%3A%7B%22field%22%3A%22files.experimental_strategy%22%2C%22value%22%3A%5B%22Tissue%20Slide%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D). 
ID’s of each WSI used in this project is available in ‘imgs.csv’ file.
To train and validate the models one would need tiles extracted from WSI’s, gene expression profiles and their respected labels for each patient.
